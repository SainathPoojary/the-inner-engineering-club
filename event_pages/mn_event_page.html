                It is the lockdown again, travel restrictions persist. But hey, that doesn’t mean we can’t hang 
                out with our friends? Although virtually, but TIE Club made sure that people don’t miss out on fun 
                and togetherness in lockdown. What better than a movie night?! <br> 
                Feel-good movies like Soul and Pursuit of Happiness gave people to come together and relax before final submissions and semester exams.
