                Humans have evolved from an insignificant species to the most advanced species on this planet because of social interaction. 
                These interactions have built relationships and communities. But how does one know if the way they are involved in socializing 
                with someone is formative, beneficial, or even safe? The backbone of this webinar was to clarify these questions and more in 
                social interactions. To recognize and respect various boundaries and understand the red flags in relationships was one of the 
                few highlights of this webinar.
