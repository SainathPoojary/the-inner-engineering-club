                   The theme for this Expressionism was Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM).
                   Since SAAM is represented by a Teal coloured ribbon, this was the foundation of the event.</p>

                April is marked as Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM). Expressionism, the flagship event of TIE had SAAM as their theme. 
                Sexual assault is severely unreported, especially on college campuses. Depending on multiple factors, Survivors can go on to 
                develop depression, PTSD, addiction, and many other psychological disorders. The performers in this event were across age groups. 
                The performers, some survivors themselves, some showing support to survivors, expressed anger, grief, and hope via their 
                performances on a Teal coloured Stage.
