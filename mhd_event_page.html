                Mental heath is one of the most neglected areas of public health.<br> 
                ‘World Mental Health Day’ is observed on 10th of October and is an opportunity for the world to come together and 
                begin redressing the prehistoric neglect of mental health. Sometimes mental illness is terrifying 
                because its like watching yourself on autopilot and having little to no control. 
                You need not to worry, TIE’ll be there for you
