                <p>On the occasion of International Youth Day, TIE Club along with Rotaract Club TSEC 
                   wanted to emphasise on the role our elders play in our lives. We asked our dearest 
                   grandparents to send in some words of wisdom for today’s youth and enlighten them 
                   with what they’ve learnt throughout their lives.</p>

                On the occasion of International Youth Day, TIE Club along with Rotaract Club TSEC wanted to emphasise 
                on the role the elders play in the lives of the youth. We asked our beloved grandparents to send in videos 
                to enlighten and remind the youth with what is actually important in our lives and what they should really 
                be focusing on. We also asked them to advice us with what the youth should or shouldn’t be doing at various 
                stages of life. This activity reassured us about some aspects of our lives, enlightening the youth with what
                 the elderly have learnt throughout their lives and helping them tackle situations in the future.
