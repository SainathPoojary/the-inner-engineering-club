                A mindful power yoga session was conducted as one of TIE Clubâ€™s summer camp initiatives. 
                Peer Mentor Udit Gupta took charge of this activity. Participation was overwhelming given 
                an early Sunday morning. The Peer Mentor in between the sets discussed the benefits of 
                working out, how often to start working out is the challenge. It can be made easy by doing 
                something you already like. Started with some yoga flow exercises, then stretches and it 
                ended with a 10-minute meditation.
