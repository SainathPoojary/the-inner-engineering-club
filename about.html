              >TIE Club was founded in 2018 with a Mission to propagate the AKA
              of Mental Health: Increasing Awareness that Mental Health issues
              exist, improving Knowledge on what these issues are & how to cope
              with them and providing Access to professional help.</b

            <b
              >The Goal was to create a conducive environment for discussion
              without judgement, for promoting a solution-oriented rather than
              problem-oriented approach. In the 2 years of operation so far, we
              have succeeded in reaching out to students one event at a time and
              creating the very kind of environment we were aiming for.</b
