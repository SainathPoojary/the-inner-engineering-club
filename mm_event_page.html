                TIE Club conducted a Mind Mapping session for all the students confused about their careers. 
                We made use of Mind Maps to visually represent and organise their thoughts related to their
                future options and careers by helping them identify and jot down their areas of interest. 
                Through this, we hoped the students would get some guidance and better insight into their 
                future options.
